\subsubsection{Required Skills}
The successful completion of this project requires that the student possesses or can easily acquire the following skills: 
%\subsection{Technical Skills}
\paragraph{Programming} A significant part of the work will be the development of algorithms and control laws to be executed by the robot. Prototyping is usually done in MATLAB and then implemented in the C++ or Python programming languages.
\paragraph{Linear Algebra} Knowledge of Linear Algebra is essential for developing robot motion control algorithms, particularly  transformations, Jacobian matrices, and matrix operations.
\paragraph{Rigid Body Dynamics} 

\subsubsection{Outcomes}
The student will become proficient in robot motion \textbf{control}. He will learn advanced concepts of robot kinematics and dynamics.
Furthermore, he will have the experience of working in a \textbf{research} environment, obtaining \textbf{experimental} skills, the ability to work independently and in a group. He will also learn how to do data analysis, scientific writing, systems engineering and programming.
The results of the student project will be included in the final demonstrator to be presented to project reviewers.
