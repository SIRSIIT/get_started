\section{Group Overview}
\subsection{IIT}
The Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT) is a public research centre based in Genova Bolzaneto.
The scientific domains of IIT are Robotics, Nanomaterials, Life Sciences and Computational Sciences.
In robotics, there are a number of research lines, ranging from humanoids, soft robots, social robotics, legged systems, human-robot interaction, dynamic systems, computer vision, etc.
\paragraph{How to get to IIT} 
There are three ways to arrive to IIT by public transportation: In the morning there are shuttles that bring people from Brin metro station at 7:45, 8:45, and 9:45. 
There is a smaller shuttle that stops at Bolzaneto train station at 7:55, 8:25m and 10:20.
There is the public bus nr. 7 that stops at the bottom of Via Morego. From there it's a 10 minute uphill walk.

\subsection{Research Areas}

In our group, we are mostly doing research in the fields of robot grasping and manipulation, teleoperation, and modelling of physical systems.

\subsection{Platforms used}
\paragraph{Hardware} In our laboratory, we have a UR5 6 Degree of freedom (DOF) robot, a Kuka iiwa7 redundant torque-controlled lightweight robot, a Pisa/IIT underactuated soft hand, and a RGB-D Kinect2 camera.
In the future, we plan on acquiring another hand/gripper and a optical tracking system.

\paragraph{Software} Within our group, we use Ubuntu Linux, with ROS (Robot Operating System)\\ \url{http://www.ros.org}. We use Gazebo \url{http://gazebosim.org} for simulations and Matlab for prototyping. Programming in the ROS framework can be done in Python or C++.
